# Powtoon Programming Guide

This programming guide was forged from a several highly trending
guides that with a personal touch.

The main goal of the guide is
to ensure that modern best practices that are widely agreed upon
in the huge JavaScript, React, and Functional Programming communities
are held throughout our whole project.

The secondary goal, that is very important as well, is to make sure
everybody style their code the same. This can partly be achieved with
linting but some rules are not and those who are still better be
documented, discussed, explained, exampled and understood.

We divide the guide into several parts:

* [The Clean Code Guide](clean-code) is about general programming
best practises and conventions considering the nature of the
JavaScript language and our strive to use Functional Programming.

* [The React Guide](react) where we sync how we use react.

* [The CSS Guide](css) where we sync how we use css.

* [The Style Guide](style-guide) where we sync our style of programming
and syntax so it looks the same all over the project.
